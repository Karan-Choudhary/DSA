Component of a Graph:
1. Node: These are the states or vertex. For instance, users in case of facebook.
2. Edges: Links between states in a graph. For instance, connections between users.

Now Edges are of two types:
1. Undirected: Two way Edges
2. Directed: One way Edges

Representation of graph:
1. With Adjacency Matrix
2. With Adjacency List

Difference between Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List:
Adjacency Matrix:
1. 2D array, where a[i][j]=1 if there is an edge from
i to j else a[i][j]=0.

0   0   0   1
0   0   0   1
0   0   0   1
1    1   1   0


Adjacency List:
1. Array of lists, where each a[i] is a list of nodes Xi that are 
reachable form i.

a -> [b,d,e]
b -> [c]
c -> [d]
d -> [a]
e -> []

We can also say that the neighbouring vertex of a are b,d,and e


Searches in a Graph:
1. Depth First Search:
It has three parts:
a. Preorder: First time when call comes on the node.
b. Inorder: When the call works inside the subtree (in DFS Tree) of that node.
c. Postorder: After working on the subtree, call comes
back on the node. After this, call won't come on the same node.

2. Breadth First Search:
***** BFS implemented using Queues *****
Different properties of components of graph
a. Weighted Nodes - Values are associated with  nodes.
b. Weighted Edges - Values are associated with edges.


Bipartite Graph:
1. Its vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U and V
such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.
2. The graph does not contain any odd-length cycles.
3. The graph is 2 colorable.

Spanning Tree:
Given an undirected and connected graph G(V,E), 
a Spanning tree of the graph G is a tree that spans
G(that is, it includes every vertex of G) and is a subgraph 
of G(every edge in tree belongs to G).

The cost of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights of all the 
edges in the tree.
There can be many spanning trees.
** If there are N vertices in the graph, then there can be N-1 edges in the tree.

Minimum Spanning Tree:
Minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree where the cost is Minimum
among all the spanning trees.
There also can be many minimum spanning trees.
