Subarray:
Continuous part of the array
Ex:
Suppose there is an array a={1, 2, 0, 7, 2, 0, 2}
So it's subarray can be sa={2, 0, 7, 2}
Number of Subarrays of an array with n elements = nC2 + n = n(n+1)/2

Subsequence:
A Subsequence is a sequence that can be derived an array by selecting zero or more
elements with changing the order of the remaining elements.
Ex:
Suppose there is an array a={1, 2, 0, 7, 2, 0, 2}
So it's subsequence can be sa={2, 7, 2}
Number of subsequences of an array with n elements = pow(2, n)

** Every subarray is a subsequence but every subsequence is not a subarray
