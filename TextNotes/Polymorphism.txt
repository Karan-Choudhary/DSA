Polymorphism - Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

Types of Polymorphism:

Virtual Functions - A function that is declared in a base class but defined in a derived class.
For this we use Virtual Keyword.
The function which has Virtual keyword is not called directly by base class but it is called indirectly.
