Catalan Numbers:
Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occur in various counting
problems, often involving recursively defined objects.
Their closed form is in terms of binomial coefficients:
C_n = (1/(n+1)) (2n C_n) = Summation(C_i C_n-i, i=0 to n-1)

Used in different counting problems like:
1. You are given with a n number of nodes, find the number of valid BSTs
that can be constructed using these nodes.
2. You are given with n vertices close polygon, find the number of triangles
that can be formed by placing cuts in the polygon.

* The value of 0th Catalan number is always fixed
    C_0 = 1
* The value of 1th Catalan number is also fixed
    C_1 = 1
* C_2 = C_0xC_1 + C_1xC_0 = 2
* C_3 = C_0xC_2 + C_1xC_1 + C_2xC_0 = 5 
* C_4 = C_0xC_3 + C_1xC_2 + C_2xC_1 + C_3xC_0 = 14

Here we observe that the value of 1st coefficient is from 0 to n-1
and the value of 2nd coefficient is from n-1 to 0.
