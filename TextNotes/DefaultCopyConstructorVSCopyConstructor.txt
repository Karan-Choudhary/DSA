Default Copy Constructor
It uses Shallow Copy to create a new object

Copy Constructor Made by us:
It uses Deep Copy to create a new object

Shallow Copy:
Suppose we have a object and it have some data members.
These data members are pointing to some dynamically allocated memory.
In Shallow copy, the pointer to the dynamically allocated memory is copied but
the locations to which they are pointing are not copied.

Deep Copy:
The pointer to the dynamically allocated memory is copied as well as 
the locations to which they are pointing are also copied.
