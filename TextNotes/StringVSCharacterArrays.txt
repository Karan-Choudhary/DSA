Character Arrays:
1. Need to know size beforehand.
2. Larger size required for operations (concatenate or append).
3. Terminated with a special character '\0'

Strings:
1. No need to know size beforehand.
2. Perform operations like concatenation and append is easier.
3. std::string stores its data internally in the form of a null-terminated 
C-string, but in normal usage does not allow you to access the null terminator
