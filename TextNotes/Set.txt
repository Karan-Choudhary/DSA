****Ordered Set****
a) Single Set
- Contains unique elements
- Implemented using balanced BST
- Elements are in sorted order
- Random access is not possible, i.e. you cannot get i'th 
element in O(1) / O(log n) time
- Present in #include<set> header file.

b) Multi Set
- Can contains duplicate elements
- implemented using balanced BST
- Elements are in sorted order,
_ Random access is not possible, i.e. you cannot get i'th
element in O(1) / O(log n) time
- Present in #include<set> header file.

****Unordered Set****
- Contains unique elements
- Implemented using a hashing
- Elements are not in sorted order
- Random access is not possible, i.e. you cannot get i'th
element is O(1)
- Present in #include<unordered_set>header file


****Time Complexities****
1. For Single Set and Multi Set:
a) Insertion: O(log n)
b) Deletion: O(log n)
c) Lower/Upper bound: O(log n)

2. For Unordered Set:
a) Insertion: O(1) in avg case, O(n) in worst case
b) Deletion: O(1) in avg case, O(n) in worst case 
c) Lower/Upper bound: NA
